resolveapitest.py tests if the DaVinci Resolve Studio V15 scripting API is responsive on MacOS.

It imports the fusionscript.so (which is of most interest to me), instantiates a resolve object and and counts how many projects are in the project manager.

The script saves a text report as it progresses.
